        <h1>Auto<br>Stop!<br>2080</h1>

        <p>An international collective research project and event with exchange between students and professors from three universities: AKBILD (Austria), PUCCH (Chile), UTDT-EAEU (Argentina). The proposal is to envision cities for the year 2080 without cars. We will work on the new urban territories that emerge from the generated hypothesis.</p>

            <h2>A week in Vienna</h2>

            <p>Is an investigative event that will produce proposals and performative actions, such as manifestos, digital dissemination, or pamphlets, aimed at raising awareness about the problems generated by personal automobiles in cities. The proposals will work towards improving the quality of life for humans and non-humans, including fauna, flora, climate, architecture, and living conditions as a collective existence.</p>
